Recap of Xamarin Summit 2019

:octocat: [Xamarin Summit GitHub](https://github.com/xamarindevelopersummit/XamDevSummit2019)

This is my very own interpretation of the summit. I may be missing some info I did not find relevant in my case, but it doesn't mean that it was not interesting.  
If you think that some major info is missing out, feel free to submit a PR! I'd be glad to accept it!

Recap by **Maddy Leger** [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/recapping-xamarin-developer-summit/)

This session extends the first one of Maddy. No new information, but some examples and cool demos.

## Page Object Pattern and UITest Best Practicies with [Sweekriti Satpathy](https://twitter.com/SweekritiS)
[Link to summit session on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YJ8TiRCsLl4?t=16514)

- State of UI Tests today
![UI Tests recap](images/XamarinUITestRecap.PNG)

- What is **Page Object Pattern**
![PageObjectPattern](images/PageObjectPattern.PNG)
Basically, each page of your app should be an object in tests.  
How we used to write tests:
```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class Tests
{
  [SetUp]
  public void BeforeEachTest()
  {
    // Set up app
  }
  
  [Test]
  public void LogInTest()
  {
    app.Tap(x => x.Id("log-in-button"));
  }
}
```
How we should to this now:
```csharp
[TestFixture]
public class Tests
{
  [SetUp]
  public void BeforeEachTest()
  {
    // Set up app
  }
  
  [Test]
  public void LogInTest()
  {
    new LogInPage().LogIn("user", "password");
  }
}
```
:octocat: Check out those examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/xamarin-automation-service/uitest-pop-example)

- In order to tweak your UI Tests, you can use [REPL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/uitest/working-with-repl?tabs=vswin) (read-eval-print-loop)

Sweekriti then made a clear and cool demo of how to write tests for an existing app. Totally worth watching.

## Streamline & Simplify Events with Reactive Extensions with [Shane Neuville](https://twitter.com/pureween)
[Link to summit session on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YJ8TiRCsLl4?t=20138)

Shane worked a lot on [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) prior working for Microsoft.

![ReactiveX](images/XamarinReactiveIntro.jpg)

This session is really worth watching in order to catch what Reactive X is and how to use it. I will not write down everything here as it would mean writing down the whole session.

## Crafting Real-Time Mobile Apps with SignalR with [James Montemagno](https://twitter.com/jamesmontemagno)

In this session, James introduce [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR), then shows a demo using it for creating a chat.  
Has I already used SignalR, this session was cool but I didn't learn anything new.

## Partly Cloudy â€“ Tips & Tricks to Using Azure to Its Fullest in Mobile Apps with [Matt Soucoup](https://twitter.com/codemillmatt)

# [DAY 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1cQsenAmNo)

## GraphQL with [Brandon Minnick](https://twitter.com/TheCodeTraveler) 
[Link to summit session on YouTube](https://youtu.be/t1cQsenAmNo?t=18547)

**GraphQL** is a language for querying complex API by explicitly asking for what data we need without doing multiple REST requests. That's pretty cool!

![graphqlexample](images/GraphQLExample.PNG)

We can play with GitHub API using GraphQL here :  
:octocat: https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/

GitHub with example used in talk :

## AppCenter with [Patrick Nikoletich](https://twitter.com/lbcpat)
[Link to summit session on YouTube](https://youtu.be/t1cQsenAmNo?t=22166)

Mainly talks about what AppCenter is, and the future of the product.

- AppCenter Auth which is a system for handling **[Azure AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory-b2c/)** authentication.
![AppCenterauth](images/AppCenterAuth.PNG)

[Link to summint session on YouTube](https://youtu.be/t1cQsenAmNo?t=25752)

Why does Xamarin.Forms Shell exists.
![Shell1](images/Shell1.PNG)

Source code of demo :  
:octocat: https://github.com/PureWeen/ReactShell/tree/master/Source

The demo shows how to use and customize Shell navigation. Really interesting!
